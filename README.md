## 📝 Notes
- Tested on HarmonyOS 3.0 (Android 10)
- If the error "Remote host closed the connection" occurs repeatedly when using sndcpy, please manually kill sndcpy on **your phone** and try again. Or fall back to VLC
```bash
    vlc -Idummy --demux rawaud --network-caching=0 --play-and-exit tcl://localhost:28200   #if you havn't changed the port number
``` 
See [Sndcpy](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) for details  

- Scrcpy might freeze if operating too fast connecting sndcpy. This is cause by the lack of mutex lock.
- Scrcpy might ignore some operations if too fast. This is caused by single-instanced ExternalProcess.
